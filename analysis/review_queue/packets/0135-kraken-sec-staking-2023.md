## Scoped Claim

"The 2023-02-09 SEC Kraken staking settlement is coded only as a U.S.-scoped centralized exchange service shutdown; it does not claim protocol-level staking censorship or token delisting." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-25
- citation[1]: `primary_corporate` replayable=`True` https://blog.kraken.com/news/settlement

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
