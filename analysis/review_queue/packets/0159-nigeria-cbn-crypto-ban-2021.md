## Scoped Claim

"CBN circular of 2021-02-05 severed Naira banking channels for cryptocurrency exchanges in Nigeria. Market substituted P2P trading networks; quantitative impact at the offramp_cex layer is captured at class level." 

## Trigger Citations

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
