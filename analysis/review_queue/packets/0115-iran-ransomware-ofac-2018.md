## Scoped Claim

"OFAC first on-chain sanction (2018-11-28 Iran ransomware facilitators) produced no observable cross-layer cascade. The targeted individuals' associated website (enexchanger.com) persisted unchanged through a 20-day window bracketing the designation. Direct asset-layer reactions are structurally impossible (Bitcoin native chain, no issuer freeze) and L1 / L3 Ethereum layers did not yet have OFAC-relevant infrastructure." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20181128
- citation[1]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
