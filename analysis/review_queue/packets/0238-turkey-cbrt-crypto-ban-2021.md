## Scoped Claim

"CBRT regulation of 2021-04-16 (effective 2021-04-30) prohibited Turkish payment service providers from handling crypto-asset-related transactions. Exchanges themselves remained operational but direct payment-rail on-ramp was severed. Observational axis at offramp_cex layer at national-policy level." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://web.archive.org/web/20210416073914/https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
