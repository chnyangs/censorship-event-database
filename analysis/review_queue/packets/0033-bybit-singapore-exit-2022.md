## Scoped Claim

"Bybit Fintech Limited wound down Singapore user-facing services on bybit.com and relocated its global headquarters to Dubai during 2022, plausibly in response to the MAS regulatory environment (PSA licensing, 2022-01-17 retail-crypto advertising restrictions, FSM Act 2022 cross-border DTSP licensing). Load-bearing observational axis is offramp_cex at the SG retail cohort level; attribution is plausible because Bybit's corporate communications do not explicitly cite MAS as the cause." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_corporate` replayable=`True` https://announcements.bybit.com/

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
