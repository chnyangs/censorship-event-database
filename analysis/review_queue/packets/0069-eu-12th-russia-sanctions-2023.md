## Scoped Claim

"EU Council Regulation 2023/2878 on 2023-12-18 extended Article 5aa of the Russia sanctions framework from an EUR 10K threshold to full prohibition on providing crypto-asset services to Russian nationals/ residents via EU CASPs. First full-prohibition user-class sanction in the dataset; observational signal is exclusively at offramp_cex layer via CASP compliance." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2878/oj

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
