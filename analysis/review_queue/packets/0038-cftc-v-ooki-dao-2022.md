## Scoped Claim

"CFTC v. Ooki DAO (2022-09-22 filing; 2023-06-08 default judgment) is the first and only CFTC enforcement action against a DAO in the dataset. Default judgment mandated US-user frontend geo-blocking with the on-chain protocol remaining functional, demonstrating the frontend/protocol split under DAO-as-legal-person enforcement." 

## Trigger Citations

- citation[0]: `primary_legal` replayable=`True` https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22

## Required Human Decisions

- Confirm this row is one concrete trigger/target unit under the codebook.
- Confirm the trigger has at least one replayable primary or admission-grade source anchor.
- Confirm layer observations still support the YAML status and scoped claim.
- Resolve only after primary-source re-extraction is complete.
